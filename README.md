steak

This is just a repo to repair my GitHub commit streak because as it turns out if
you contribute to a repository that is later deleted GitHub will [retroactively nix](https://twitter.com/jdalton/status/511540503045627904)
your streak. I've taken screenshots of the original commits and used them as commit
placeholders to repair my streak.
